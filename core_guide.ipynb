    "This document is meant to be a hands-on guide for the compilation of the INCA Core which is at its essence a model-building tool, written in C++, that allows for rapid model prototyping at the cost of computational performance. It is meant to be deployed as a _library_ against which your program should _link_ in order to create models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going through this page, the reader is encouraged to browse the existing technical manual and the _*\\.pptx_ presentations describing the Core, its philosophy and implementation. These can be found on [github repository](https://github.com/biogeochemistry/INCA/tree/master/documentation) where the INCA source is stored. Please see the [preliminary requirements](#prel_req) section of this document for an explanation on how to get access to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Core is a **model-building tool** resulting from the necessity of providing a structured, clear, and easily maintainable code base with which to build  and further advance the INCA family of models. This necessity arose from 20+ years of near-organic growth of the INCA models and the limitations this imposed on maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is written in C++ and the programming style is object oriented. One of the main arguments in favor of object-oriented programming is its ability to provide _encapsulation_, i.e. divide the code into layers of complexity. This requires careful planning for the structure of the code (and as such complicates structural changes), but allows rapid development, which is a definite benefit for model prototyping. Encapsulating data accesses and more importantly, operations on data allows to layering the degree of understanding of the C++ code required to interact with the core. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its outermost, or simplest, level, the Core allows for the creation of models by specifying model parameters, inputs, outputs and equations (and their linkages) and provides a variety of solvers (which can be specified and/or added). It automatically creates all looping traditionally required in time-dependent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interact with the Core at this level it is not necessary to be fluent with C++ but familiarity with it is an advantage. This document deals with usage of the Core at this level and aims to:\n",
